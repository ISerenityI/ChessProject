Chess Engine created using python
This project consist of two scripts. One is responisble for the UI and the other for the game (chess engine). The other file present are the images used to display the
actual chess pieces. Pygame was the only libary used in the development of this chess engine. Currently working on improvements, fixing certain bugs and an AI for 
evaluating chess moves and positions.
